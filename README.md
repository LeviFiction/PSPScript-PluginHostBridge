# PSPScript-PluginHostBridge
A script to call a commandline plugin host for 32-bit photoshop plugins

Using the Photoshop Plugin Host from Spectric - https://github.com/spetric/Photoshop-Plugin-Host

I've compiled the cappspi test commandline program provided with the Plugin Host source ocde, with small updates to make it work better with my script.  And created a script to call the host from within PaintShop Pro.  And then load back the results.  Acting like the bridge program from MediaChance.
